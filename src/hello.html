    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Directle is a quick and fun daily word game that encourages abstract thinking about semantics of words. Directly helps to expand oneâ€™s vocabulary and become more creative. This is done with the power of word2vec, an algorithm to embed words in high-dimensional vector spaces based on their semantics. </p>
